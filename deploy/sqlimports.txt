#Import the bins and pallets

#update bin to pallet associations

#import users, must give unique email address

#import clients, add all to provider

#import descriptions, add new storageitem for each (Manual CSV paste into table)


-- IMPORT current transactions and pallet-contents into new tables
import-transactions.csv and import-pallet-contents.csv
#remove pallets from transactions import that are not currently in pallets import
 -- first do a select to see what they are because it should be nothing
DELETE FROM import-transactions WHERE import-transactions WHERE palletID NOT IN (SELECT id from storagepallet)



The remaining items were done with scripting

 - create storage requests
 - add the actual pallet inventory
 - update pallet inventory with item id
 - update pallet inventory with storage request id
 - update storage request with actual qty
